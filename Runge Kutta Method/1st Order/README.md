The **Runge-Kutta 1st Order Method** is the simplest numerical method used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial condition. It is better known as **Euler‚Äôs Method**.

---

## üìò Overview

Euler‚Äôs Method approximates the solution to the first-order ODE:

```
dy/dx = f(x, y), with y(x‚ÇÄ) = y‚ÇÄ
```

By incrementally computing:

```
y‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = y‚Çô + h * f(x‚Çô, y‚Çô)
```

Where:
- `h` is the step size
- `(x‚Çô, y‚Çô)` is the current point
- `f(x, y)` is the derivative function

---

## üßÆ Formula Summary

```text
Given:
  dy/dx = f(x, y)
  y(x‚ÇÄ) = y‚ÇÄ

Then:
  y‚ÇÅ = y‚ÇÄ + h * f(x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ)
  y‚ÇÇ = y‚ÇÅ + h * f(x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ)
  ...
  y‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = y‚Çô + h * f(x‚Çô, y‚Çô)
```

---

## üí° Example (Python)

Solving:

```
dy/dx = 3x + y/2,  with y(0) = 1 and h = 0.1
```

**Python Code:**

```python
def f(x, y):
    return 3 * x + y / 2

x = 0
y = 1
h = 0.1
x_target = 0.5

while x < x_target:
    y += h * f(x, y)
    x += h

print(f"Approximate value at x = {x_target} is y ‚âà {y:.4f}")
```
