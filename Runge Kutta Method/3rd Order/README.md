# Runge-Kutta 3rd Order Method (RK3)

The **Runge-Kutta 3rd Order Method (RK3)** is a numerical method for approximating the solutions of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It provides a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost ‚Äî more accurate than RK2, but simpler than RK4.

## üìò Problem Statement

Given a first-order ODE:

```
dy/dx = f(x, y), with y(x‚ÇÄ) = y‚ÇÄ
```

We estimate the solution at `x = x‚ÇÄ + h` using three weighted slope evaluations.

## üî¢ RK3 Formula

```text
k1 = h * f(x‚Çô, y‚Çô)
k2 = h * f(x‚Çô + h/2, y‚Çô + k1/2)
k3 = h * f(x‚Çô + h, y‚Çô - k1 + 2*k2)

y‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = y‚Çô + (1/6) * (k1 + 4*k2 + k3)
```

Where:
- `h` is the step size
- `k1`, `k2`, `k3` are slope estimates at different points

## üí° Example (Python)

Solving:

```
dy/dx = 3x + y/2, with y(0) = 1, h = 0.1
```

**Python Code:**

```python
def f(x, y):
    return 3 * x + y / 2

x = 0
y = 1
h = 0.1
x_target = 0.5

while x < x_target:
    k1 = h * f(x, y)
    k2 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k1/2)
    k3 = h * f(x + h, y - k1 + 2 * k2)
    y += (k1 + 4 * k2 + k3) / 6
    x += h

print(f"Approximate value at x = {x_target} is y ‚âà {y:.4f}")
```
