The Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method (RK4) is a powerful numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) when an analytical solution is difficult or impossible.

## üìò Overview

Given a first-order differential equation:

```
dy/dx = f(x, y),  with  y(x‚ÇÄ) = y‚ÇÄ
```

The RK4 method estimates the value of `y` at a given point using:

```
k‚ÇÅ = h * f(x‚Çô, y‚Çô)
k‚ÇÇ = h * f(x‚Çô + h/2, y‚Çô + k‚ÇÅ/2)
k‚ÇÉ = h * f(x‚Çô + h/2, y‚Çô + k‚ÇÇ/2)
k‚ÇÑ = h * f(x‚Çô + h,   y‚Çô + k‚ÇÉ)

y‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = y‚Çô + (1/6) * (k‚ÇÅ + 2k‚ÇÇ + 2k‚ÇÉ + k‚ÇÑ)
```

Where:
- `h` is the step size
- `(x‚Çô, y‚Çô)` is the current point

## üí° Example (Python)

Solving:
```
dy/dx = 3x + y/2, with y(0) = 1, h = 0.1
```

**Python Implementation:**

```python
def f(x, y):
    return 3 * x + y / 2

x = 0
y = 1
h = 0.1
x_target = 0.5

while x < x_target:
    k1 = h * f(x, y)
    k2 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k1/2)
    k3 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k2/2)
    k4 = h * f(x + h, y + k3)

    y += (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6
    x += h

print(f"Approximate value at x = {x_target} is y ‚âà {y:.4f}")
```
