# Newton-Raphson Method

## Overview
The **Newton-Raphson Method** is an iterative numerical technique used to find approximate roots of real-valued functions. It is one of the most efficient root-finding methods, widely applied in mathematics, physics, and engineering.

## How It Works
1. Choose an initial guess \( x_0 \).
2. Compute the next approximation using the formula:
   
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
   \]
   
3. Repeat until the change between iterations is below a predefined tolerance.

## Advantages
- **Fast Convergence:** Quadratic convergence for well-behaved functions.
- **Simple to Implement:** Requires only function evaluation and differentiation.

## Disadvantages
- **Requires Derivative Calculation:** Needs \( f'(x) \), which may not always be easy to compute.
- **May Fail for Poor Initial Guesses:** Can diverge if the function is not well-behaved or if \( f'(x) \) is close to zero.

## Applications
- Solving nonlinear equations in science and engineering.
- Root-finding in physics and economics.
- Optimizing functions in machine learning and data science.

## Example
To find the root of \( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \), we use:

\[
 x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^2 - 4}{2x_n}
 \]

Starting with \( x_0 = 3 \), the method quickly converges to \( x = 2 \), the correct root.

## Conclusion
The Newton-Raphson Method is a powerful and efficient tool for solving equations but requires careful selection of initial guesses and well-defined functions for best results.
