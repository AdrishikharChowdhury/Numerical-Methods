# Gauss Elimination Method

This repository provides an implementation of the **Gauss Elimination method**, a fundamental algorithm in linear algebra for solving systems of linear equations. It's a systematic procedure for transforming a system's augmented matrix into an upper triangular form, which can then be solved using back substitution.

## üìú Algorithm Overview

The Gauss Elimination method operates in two main phases:

1. **Forward Elimination**: The primary goal of this phase is to reduce the system's augmented matrix into **row echelon form** (an upper triangular matrix). This is achieved by sequentially applying elementary row operations to eliminate the coefficients below the main diagonal.
2. **Back Substitution**: Once the matrix is in upper triangular form, the system becomes straightforward to solve. The last equation contains only one variable. Its value is found first. Then, moving upward, this value is substituted into the second-to-last equation to find the next variable, and this process continues until all variables are solved.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Process

Given a system of `n` linear equations with `n` variables:

1. **Augmented Matrix**: Represent the system of equations as an augmented matrix `[A|B]`, where `A` is the matrix of coefficients and `B` is the vector of constant terms.
2. **Forward Elimination**:
a. Select the first element of the first row, `A`, as the pivot.
b. For each subsequent row `i` below the pivot row, calculate the ratio `r = A[i] / A`.
c. Subtract `r` times the pivot row from row `i`. This will make the element `A[i]` zero.
d. Repeat this process, selecting the next diagonal element (`A`, `A`, etc.) as the pivot and eliminating the coefficients below it.
e. Continue until the matrix `A` is in upper triangular form.
3. **Back Substitution**:
a. Solve for the last variable (`x_n`) using the last row of the modified matrix.
b. Substitute this value into the second-to-last equation to solve for `x_{n-1}`.
c. Continue this process, working from the bottom up, until all variables have been found.

## üß™ Worked Example

Let's solve the following system of equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
2x + y - z = 8 \\
-3x - y + 2z = -11 \\
-2x + y + 2z = -3
\end{cases}
$$

#### 1. Augmented Matrix

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
2 & 1 & -1 & 8 \\
-3 & -1 & 2 & -11 \\
-2 & 1 & 2 & -3
\end{array}
\right]
$$

#### 2. Forward Elimination

**Step A: Eliminate the first column below the pivot `A=2`**

- `R2 ‚Üí R2 - (-3/2) * R1`
- `R3 ‚Üí R3 - (-2/2) * R1` which is `R3 ‚Üí R3 + R1`

This gives:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
2 & 1 & -1 & 8 \\
0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 1 \\
0 & 2 & 1 & 5
\end{array}
\right]
$$

**Step B: Eliminate the second column below the pivot `A=0.5`**

- `R3 ‚Üí R3 - (2 / 0.5) * R2` which is `R3 ‚Üí R3 - 4 * R2`

This gives the final upper triangular matrix:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
2 & 1 & -1 & 8 \\
0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 1
\end{array}
\right]
$$

#### 3. Back Substitution

Now, rewrite the system from the new matrix:

$$
\begin{cases}
2x + y - z = 8 \\
0.5y + 0.5z = 1 \\
-z = 1
\end{cases}
$$

- From the last equation:
$-z = 1 \implies \mathbf{z = -1}$
- Substitute `z = -1` into the second equation:
$0.5y + 0.5(-1) = 1 \implies 0.5y - 0.5 = 1 \implies 0.5y = 1.5 \implies \mathbf{y = 3}$
- Substitute `y = 3` and `z = -1` into the first equation:
$2x + (3) - (-1) = 8 \implies 2x + 4 = 8 \implies 2x = 4 \implies \mathbf{x = 2}$


#### Final Solution

The solution is `(x, y, z) = (2, 3, -1)`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è An Important Consideration: Pivoting

The "naive" Gauss Elimination described above fails if a pivot element on the diagonal becomes zero, as this would lead to division by zero. To handle this and to improve numerical stability (by avoiding small pivot values), a strategy called **pivoting** is used.

**Partial Pivoting**, the most common method, involves searching the current column for the element with the largest absolute value and swapping its row with the current pivot row before performing the elimination step. This ensures the pivot is as large as possible, making the algorithm more robust and accurate.

## üöÄ Applications

The Gauss Elimination method is a cornerstone of numerical analysis and is used for:

- Solving systems of linear equations in engineering, physics, and computer graphics.
- Calculating the determinant of a matrix.
- Finding the inverse of a matrix.
- Determining the rank of a matrix.
